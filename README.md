# Description
# For file 746_idi-1-1.c
This is a comb sort code for determining average value of comparing and swapping by making 100 sorts with random values and different lengths of array: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, 100, 250 and 500. There you can choose the length of the array.

# For file 746_idi-1-3.c
This is a Hoare sort code for determining average value of comparing and swapping by making 100 sorts with random values and different lengths of array: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, 100, 250 and 500. There you can choose the length of the array.
# For file 746_idi-1-4.c
This is a Heap sort code for determining average value of comparing and swapping by making 100 sorts with random values and different lengths of array: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, 100, 250 and 500. There you can choose the length of the array.
# For file 746_idi-2.c
This is a code for graph program for finding the shortest path from some vertex A of graph G to all other vertices of this graph and a contour of minimal length (a cycle passing through each vertex exactly once and having a minimum weight).
